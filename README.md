# Challenge

This challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I will take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database.

# How it works

When given a functional Express.js API I will add my database name, PostgreSQL username, and PostgreSQL password to an environment variable file.
I am then able to connect to a database using Sequelize when I enter schema and seed commands. Then development database is created and is seeded with test data and when I enter the command to invoke the application my server starts and the Sequelize models are synced to the PostgreSQL database.
I then open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags and the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON then I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, Finally I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
